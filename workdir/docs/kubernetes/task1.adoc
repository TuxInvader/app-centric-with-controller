== 1.1 Introduction

We're going to use Ansible to get a few things set up. We cover Ansible in a lot more detail
in the App Centric workshop, but on this course, we're just going to run a few playbooks to deploy our
Kubernetes cluster.

== 1.2 Boot strap the nodes

The workshop deployment process has already deployed your Virtual Machines, and configured the 
gateway machine. The first task we have to complete together is to assign identities to the VMs
in your private network. 

Please change to the ansible folder on your gateway and execute the node_setup playbook.

----
$ cd ~/ansible
$ ansible-playbook node_setup_playbook.yaml
----

Hopefully those tasks all completed successfully, and the final output from Ansible is a _PLAY RECAP_
containing only changed and ok statuses.

With that done, we're a step closer to having a useful workshop envionment. In task 2 we'll install NGINX on the
gateway to open up access to the nodes you just configured. But before we can do that, we need to install
an ansible role to help us.

'''
== 1.3 Setup Kubernetes

We're going to deploy Kubernetes across 4 nodes running in the private network. The node_setup playbook you
just ran has assigned hostnames to them as 'k8s1, k8s2, k8s3, and k8s4'. Now we're going to install `docker` and
the kubernetes packages: `kubeadm`, `kubectl` and `kubelet`.

Please run the deployment playbook

----
$ cd ~/ansible
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/kubernetes/deploy.yaml
----

We've installed `docker` as our container runtime. The `kubeadm` package is a tool for managing Kubernetes clusters,
the `kubectl` command is the tool we'll be using most during the course and it's job is to help us interact with
the kubernetes API. Finally `kubelet` is the kubernetes node agent, it runs on each node in the cluster to manage
the containers (both our containers, and the kubernetes system itself).

The next task in deploying a kubernetes cluster is to setup the 'primary' node.

----
$ cd ~/ansible
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/kubernetes/setup_primary.yaml
----

The above playbook uses `kubeadm` to create a new cluster, and then sets up the control plane components. Then we deploy a
CNI for the pod networks (we're using flannel for simplicity), finally it retrieves and saves the API tokens which we'll
need to join our other nodes into the cluster.

Next we use the join command we retrieved from the primary node, to link our other hosts into the kubernetes cluster

----
$ cd ~/ansible
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/kubernetes/setup_nodes.yaml
----

Finally we'll install the `kubectl` command on your gateway, and copy over the authentication keys from the primary
node:

----
$ cd ~/ansible
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/kubernetes/setup_local.yaml
----
