== 6.1 Deploy some monitoring

Most Kubernetes Knights, like NGINX Ninjas, and F5 Frequent Flyers enjoy the magesty of a properly configured monitoring
solution. In Kubernetes land, the most common tool for that sort of thing is Prometheus.

NGINX KIC has native support for prometheus, so it would seem rude not to deploy some. First lets set a grafana password,
we'll use the same one basic auth password from `~/secrets/basic_auth_passwd`

----
$ grafpass=$( cat ~/secrets/basic_auth.passwd )
$ sed -i -re "s/_PASSWORD_/'$grafpass'/" monitoring/04_grafana_deploy.yaml
----

Once we've set that, we'll deploy the monitoring stuff.....

----
$ kubectl apply -f monitoring/01_namespace.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f monitoring/02_configmap_prom.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f monitoring/02_configmap_graf.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f monitoring/03_prom_deploy.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f monitoring/04_grafana_deploy.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f monitoring/06_vservers.yaml
----

time to hit up `app.<fqdn>` and login as `admin` with your basic auth password.

Lovely....... What it didn't work? Well it works for me ;-)

Actually, here's the thing...... we're done with the whole ansible automation thing now. You're here to learn Kubernetes,
and well it's about time you started doing some of this stuff yourself. In each of the applications we're going to deploy
from here in, you'll likely have to change some hostnames in the `Ingress` and/or `VirtualServer` resources to match the
names in your workshop.

Open the `monitoring/06-vservers.yaml` file in your editor of choice. The file contains two `VirtualServer` resources, the
first one is for prometheus and looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.nginx.org/v1
kind: VirtualServer
metadata:
  name: prometheus-ingress
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  host: "prom.foo.bar"
  upstreams:
  - name: web9090
    service: prometheus-service
    port: 9090
  routes:
  - path: /
    action:
      pass: web9090
----

You'll need to change the `host` line to match your workshop domain, eg `prom.wsXX.nginxdemodomainthatwereusingthisweek.com`, and
do the same for the grafana entry too, only that one should be `graf.wsXX.nginxdemodomainthatwereusingthisweek.com`.

Once you've fixed those two lines, you only need to apply the vservers fail again to fix everything.

----
$ kubectl apply -f monitoring/06_vservers.yaml
----

Enjoy.

== 6.2 What Cheese

Now we're going to look at the demo app... change to the whatcheese directory and have a look at the manifests.
