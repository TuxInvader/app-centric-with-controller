== Introduction

Now we're going to deploy some tools for CI/CD automation. We'll be using a free Open Source Git repository
server with a github like HTTP interface called https://gitea.io/en-us/[Gitea], and for orchestration automation
we'll be using https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins]

'''
== Install a role to help install Jenkins

----
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.jenkins`

'''
== Run the playbook

----
ansible-playbook playbooks/cicd/deploy.yaml
