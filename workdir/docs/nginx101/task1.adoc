== 1.1 Introduction

We're going to use Ansible to get a few things set up. We cover Ansible in a lot more detail
in the App Centric workshop, but on this course, we're just going to run a few playbooks to deploy
docker onto cicd1.

== 1.2 Boot strap the nodes

The workshop deployment process has already deployed your Virtual Machines, and configured the 
gateway instance. The first task we have to complete together is to assign identities to the VMs
in your private network. 

Please change to the ansible folder on your gateway and execute the node_setup playbook.

----
$ cd ~/ansible
$ ansible-playbook node_setup_playbook.yaml
----

Hopefully those tasks all completed successfully, and the final output from Ansible is a _PLAY RECAP_
containing only changed, ok or skipped statuses.

With that done, we're a step closer to having a useful workshop environment.

In the next task, we'll deploy NGINX Plus and the demo site onto docker.
So, let's move on to <<task2.adoc#,Task 2>>
