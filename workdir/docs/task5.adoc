From NetOps to DevOps, modern app teams need a self‑service, API‑driven platform that integrates easily
into CI/CD workflows to accelerate app deployment – whether your app has a hybrid or microservices
architecture – and makes app lifecycle management easier.

****
Built to manage NGINX Plus instances, NGINX Controller is cloud‑native, secure, and high‑performance.
